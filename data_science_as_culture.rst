Data science as culture

What is data science?
*********************

The fathers of data science are the statisticians John Tukey (see [1, 2]) and
Leo Breimam (see [3]).  Both emphasized the need for flexibility and fluidity
in data analysis.  To quote Tukey: [1] "Far better an approximate answer to
the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong
question, which can always be made precise."  Breiman's 2001 paper [3]
contrasts "data modeling culture" with "algorithmic modeling culture", where
the algorithmic modeling community is "often called machine learning".  He
describes his approach to data analysis as:

"(a) Focus on finding a good solution - that's what consultants get paid for.
(b) Live with the data before you plunge into modeling.
(c) Search for a model that gives a good solution, either algorithmic or data.
(d) Predictive accuracy on test sets is the criterion for how good the model is.
(e) Computers are an indispensable partner." [3]

I believe that the term "data science" is another name for the culture of data
analysis that both Tukey and Breiman are describing.  This new term has
emerged now because this culture has shown itself to be successful in adapting
to a wide range of difficult data analysis problems.  As Breiman implies in
his point (e) above, part of this success has been because there are a much
larger number of scientists who can write valid and effective code.  This in
turn is due to the success of open source scientific computing, and with it,
the increasing use of standard tools improving code quality.

I think we are going to see a rather rapid change in data analysis across many
fields, as the benefits of data science methods become more obvious.  If we
are early in this movement, we will have a chance to reap these benefits
making us more effective at research, and more attractive as a teaching
university, for future employment in industry and research.

Recruiting for data science

I think that it would be most effective to concentrate on searching for
individuals who are leaders in this new culture, across domains.  This culture
is not exactly "machine learning", but it does involve flexibility in data
analysis, and a willingness to engage with computational methods.  We want to
spread this culture, so we want to hire people who have already shown that
they too want to spread this culture, and have done so in their home
institutions.  Meanwhile, we want to foster this culture in our own students
and post-docs, by teaching and by example.  Undergraduate teaching should
involve substantial open data analysis projects, where students are encouraged
to explore the data and find new methods of exploration and inference.  We
should give students a foundation in computer programming in a high-level
language that will allow them to make new algorithms, and be flexible in
applying old ones.
